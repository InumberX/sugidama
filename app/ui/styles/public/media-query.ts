// Ported from auba-general-view: app/styles/mixins/mediaQuery.css.ts
//
// Two adaptations for Remix:
//
// 1. These hold the WHOLE at-rule (`@media screen and ...`). `css(...)` takes
//    the at-rule itself as the object key, where vanilla-extract took only the
//    condition under an `'@media'` parent.
//
// 2. They are constants, not functions. A `css(...)` computed key must have a
//    literal type: a helper returning `string` makes TypeScript infer a string
//    index signature for the object literal, which then clashes with the
//    numeric index signature `CSSProps` inherits from `CSSStyleDeclaration`
//    ("'string' and 'number' index signatures are incompatible"). Every value
//    here is built from a `BREAKPOINTS` literal inside an `as const` object, so
//    the literal type survives and the constant drops straight into a key:
//
//      css({ color: 'red', [MEDIA_QUERY.MD]: { color: 'blue' } })
//
// Upper bounds are exclusive (`width < Npx`), which Media Queries Level 4 range
// syntax gives directly — the same syntax the lower bounds already use. Writing
// them as `<= (Npx - 1)` would need a second constant object, because TypeScript
// has no type-level arithmetic and `${BREAKPOINTS.md - 1}` degrades the string
// to a `${number}` pattern, breaking the computed key described above.
//
// Plain CSS cannot read these, so `public/static/css/app.css` writes its own
// conditions by hand — there is no PostCSS `@custom-media` here.
//
// Most of the entries below have no caller yet: this is the query vocabulary a
// project starting from the template writes against, kept complete so a
// breakpoint is never spelled out inline. Do not prune them as dead code.
